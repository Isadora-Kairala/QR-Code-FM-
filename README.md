## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

During this challenge, I learned how to center elements using Flexbox and how to apply border-radius and box-shadow to create a modern and clean look. I also gained a better understanding of how margin, padding, and position affect the layout of components.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Useful resources

- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex) - It helped me center the card in a simple way.
- (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - An excellent visual guide that I use as a reference.
